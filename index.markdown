# NIH Bioinformatics Organizations Community Directory

## Overview

There are a lot of different bioinformatics and bioinformatics-adjacent organizations at NIH.
Many of them hold regular events, communicate via mailing lists/slack or some other mechanism, and
may be of interest to people doing bioinformatics-related work at NIH.

At present, however, there is no overarching "NIH Bioinformatics Institute" that sits above all of
these, and instead, the different groups are scattered across the various divisions at NIH.

As such, it can be difficult for someone who is interested in this topic to find out about all of
the different Bioinformatics groups at campus.

This page is an attempt to bring together some of the basic information about these organizations,
so that interested individuals know where to look to find out more information about the groups,
how to communicate with them, what kinds of events they might expect from them, etc.

If you notice something missing or incorrect from this page, feel free to [open an issue to let us
know and/or submit a pull request](https://github.com/nih-byob/nih-orgs) with the suggested changes.

## Organizations

**Bioinformatics @ NIAID**

> Here you can find training materials on a wide variety of topics from next generation sequencing
> (NGS) to molecular dynamics.

**Bioinformatics Special Interest Group (BSIG)**

> The Bioinformatics SIG aims to promote collaboration and knowledge-sharing among computational
> biologists across the NIH. The group also strives to provide a forum for researchers who have an
> interest in applying computational approaches to their own work to meet with experienced
> computational biologists, thereby establishing a network through which productive scientific
> collaborations can be fostered and encouraged

**Bring Your Own Bioinformatics (BYOB)**

> NIH BYOB is an informal, community-led talk series that meets once a month for presentations and
> discussions relating to topics of interest among the NIH bioinformatics community.

At present, BYOB is primarily serving as a discussion forum via its Slack channels. Talks may resume
in 2023, pending volunteer signup.
